        </div>

        <!-- ============================== -->
        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <!-- ============================== -->
        <div class="card">
            <p>The calculator takes your body composition, age, activity level, and goals, then runs them through seven steps grounded in peer-reviewed research. Each step builds on the previous one, so your final calorie and protein targets reflect <em>your</em> biology — not a one-size-fits-all estimate.</p>
            <p>Below, we explain every step: what it does, which formula it uses, why it matters, and where the science comes from. All calculations happen in your browser; no data is sent anywhere.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ============================== -->
        <!-- STEP 1: BODY COMPOSITION -->
        <!-- ============================== -->
        <div class="card">
            <div class="section-header">
                <span class="step-number">1</span>
                <span class="section-title">Body Composition Analysis</span>
            </div>

            <p>The first thing the calculator does is split your weight into two components: <strong>fat mass</strong> and <strong>lean body mass</strong> (LBM). It does the same for your target weight. The difference between current and target tells the calculator exactly how much fat you need to lose and how much muscle you need to gain. This two-compartment approach has been validated against multi-compartment reference models with high accuracy <span class="cite" title="Clasey, J.L., et al. (1999). Journal of Applied Physiology, 86(5), 1728-1738. doi:10.1152/jappl.1999.86.5.1728">[19]</span>.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <span class="label">Formulas</span>
                Fat mass = Weight × (Body fat % ÷ 100)<br>
                Lean body mass = Weight − Fat mass
            </div>

            <p>For example, an 85 kg person at 25% body fat carries 21.3 kg of fat and 63.8 kg of lean mass. If their target is 80 kg at 18%, that means 14.4 kg fat and 65.6 kg lean — a net loss of 6.9 kg fat and a gain of 1.9 kg lean mass.</p>

            <div class="why-box">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Working with fat and lean mass separately is more accurate than tracking weight alone. You can weigh the same but have a completely different body composition. This distinction drives every decision the calculator makes — from goal classification to calorie targets.
            </div>

            <p>The calculator then classifies your goal into one of five modes based on these tissue changes: <strong>Maintenance</strong> (minimal change), <strong>Body Recomposition</strong> (losing fat and gaining muscle at the same weight), <strong>Recomp + Weight Loss</strong> (both tissues changing while overall weight drops), <strong>Fat Loss</strong> (losing fat, preserving muscle), or <strong>Muscle Building</strong> (gaining lean mass in a surplus). Each mode triggers different calorie and protein strategies in later steps.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ============================== -->
        <!-- STEP 2: BMR & TDEE -->

            </div>

            <p>Your <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate</strong> (BMR) is the energy your body burns at complete rest — just keeping organs running, body temperature stable, and cells functioning. The calculator uses the <strong>Katch-McArdle formula</strong>, a variant of the LBM-based BMR equation first validated by Cunningham in a reanalysis of the Harris-Benedict data. It bases BMR on lean body mass rather than total weight because muscle tissue is far more metabolically active than fat tissue, making LBM the single strongest predictor of resting energy expenditure <span class="cite" title="Cunningham, J.J. (1980). American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 33(11), 2372-2374. doi:10.1093/ajcn/33.11.2372">[1]</span>.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <span class="label">Katch-McArdle Formula</span>
                BMR = 370 + (21.6 × Lean Body Mass in kg)
            </div>

            <p>Your <strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure</strong> (TDEE) accounts for physical activity on top of BMR. The calculator multiplies BMR by a standard activity factor. These multipliers were developed from metabolic research and are widely used in clinical nutrition; the underlying basal metabolism framework originates from Harris and Benedict <span class="cite" title="Harris, J.A. & Benedict, F.G. (1918). Carnegie Institution of Washington">[2]</span>.</p>

                <strong>Why Katch-McArdle?</strong> Unlike the Mifflin-St Jeor or Harris-Benedict equations, which use total weight, Katch-McArdle uses lean mass. This means a 90 kg person at 15% body fat gets a very different (and more accurate) BMR than a 90 kg person at 35% body fat. For anyone tracking body composition, this formula is the better choice.

            </div>

            <p>Before estimating how fast you can build muscle, the calculator needs to know where you stand relative to your genetic ceiling. It does this using the <strong>Fat-Free Mass Index</strong> (FFMI) — a height-normalized measure of muscularity introduced by Kouri et al. in a landmark 1995 study of natural and steroid-using athletes <span class="cite" title="Kouri, E.M., et al.

                FFMI = Lean Body Mass ÷ (Height in meters)²
            </div>

            <p>That study found that drug-free male athletes rarely exceeded an FFMI of 25, establishing this as the practical natural ceiling. For women, research by Schutz et al. and Abe et al. places the equivalent ceiling around 21 <span class="cite" title="Schutz, Y., et al. (2002).

            <p>The calculator personalizes your ceiling using a height-adjusted model for men (maximum lean body mass = height in cm × 0.407 + 8.6 kg, with a floor of FFMI 24.5), consistent with the upper limits observed in natural athletes by Kouri et al. <span class="cite" title="Kouri, E.M., et al. (1995). Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 5(4), 223-228. doi:10.1097/00042752-199510000-00003">[3]</span><span class="cite" title="Schutz, Y., et al. (2002). International Journal of Obesity, 26(7), 953-960. doi:10.1038/sj.ijo.0802037">[4]</span>. For women, a constant FFMI ceiling of 21.0 is used. After age 40, the ceiling decreases slightly due to age-related sarcopenia. Longitudinal data show that adults lose roughly 0.5% of muscle mass per year after age 50, with the rate accelerating after 60 <span class="cite" title="Mitchell, W.K., et al. (2012). Frontiers in Physiology, 3, 260. doi:10.3389/fphys.2012.00260">[6]</span>. The calculator applies a conservative FFMI reduction (0.3 points per decade for men, 0.15 for women) to model this decline.</p>

            <p><strong>Proximity to ceiling</strong> is the key output. It represents how much growth potential remains, scaled from 0 (at ceiling) to 1 (untrained baseline):</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <span class="label">Proximity to Ceiling</span>
                Proximity = (Ceiling FFMI − Current FFMI) ÷ (Ceiling FFMI − Baseline FFMI)
            </div>

            <p>Baseline FFMI is set at 18.5 for men and 15.0 for women, representing an untrained starting point. This proximity value directly scales your expected muscle gain rate in the next step.</p>

            <div class="why-box">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong> A beginner with an FFMI of 19 has far more growth potential than an advanced lifter at FFMI 23. Without accounting for this, the calculator would overestimate timelines for beginners and underestimate them for experienced trainees. The proximity model, inspired by the year-by-year gain curves published by Aragon and McDonald, captures this diminishing-returns pattern <span class="cite" title="Aragon, A.A. (2020). The Aragon model for rate of muscle gain">[7]</span>.

            <p>The timeline is not a guess — it is derived from two biological rate limits: how fast you can safely lose fat and how fast you can build muscle. The slower process becomes the bottleneck that determines total duration.</p>

            <p><strong>Muscle gain rate</strong> combines three factors: the proximity-to-ceiling value from Step 3, a sex-based maximum rate, and an age modifier reflecting the decline in muscle protein synthesis efficiency with age.

            <p><strong>Fat loss rate</strong> scales the safe rate of weight loss to your current body fat percentage. The principle is grounded in Alpert's finding that human fat stores can release a maximum of approximately 31 kcal per pound of body fat per day — meaning leaner individuals have a lower ceiling for safe daily energy deficit <span class="cite" title="Alpert, S.S. (2005). Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(1), 1-13. doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.08.020">[5]</span>. People with more body fat can sustain a faster rate of loss without muscle sacrifice, while leaner individuals need to go slower. A controlled trial in elite athletes by Garthe et al. confirmed this in practice: a slow rate (0.7% body weight per week) preserved lean mass significantly better than a fast rate (1.4% per week) <span class="cite" title="Garthe, I., et al.

            <p>The calorie target is where everything comes together. Instead of applying a fixed surplus or deficit, the calculator derives your calories directly from the tissue changes and timeline established in the previous steps. This is what we call a <strong>target-weight-aligned approach</strong>: the calorie balance is mathematically matched to the rate of change your body can sustain, so you don't accumulate unwanted fat from an oversized surplus or lose muscle from an overly aggressive deficit.</p>

            <p>Two energy constants underpin the calculation. Building one kilogram of muscle requires roughly 2,500 kcal of tissue energy plus metabolic overhead. Losing one kilogram of fat liberates approximately 7,700 kcal, a figure that has been consistent across calorimetry studies for decades <span class="cite" title="Hall, K.D. (2008).

            <p>This rate-matched approach is inspired by the recommendations of Helms et al., who suggest that lean bulking surpluses should be 200–300 kcal for beginners and scale down as training advancement increases <span class="cite" title="Helms, E.R., et al. (2014). Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, 11, 20. doi:10.1186/1550-2783-11-20">[12]</span>. The key insight is that a beginner who can gain 1 kg of muscle per month needs a larger surplus than an advanced lifter gaining 0.15 kg per month. A fixed surplus for the advanced lifter would simply convert the excess into fat.</p>

                <strong>Important: body weight vs. lean body mass.</strong> Phillips' recommendation of 1.2–1.6 g/kg refers to <em>total body weight</em> and represents a <strong>minimum floor</strong> for general health — not an optimal target for people who are actively training or in a calorie deficit. Our calculator uses g/kg <em>lean body mass</em>, which produces higher-looking numbers but similar absolute protein amounts. For example, an 85 kg person at 25% body fat (LBM = 63.8 kg): Phillips' 1.6 g/kg BW = 136 g/day, while our maintenance target of 1.6 g/kg LBM = 102 g/day — actually <em>less</em> than the minimum Phillips recommends. Our deficit and recomp targets (2.0–2.4 g/kg LBM = 128–153 g) sit right in line with what the research supports for active individuals aiming to preserve or build muscle.
            </div>

            <p>The multiplier varies by goal mode. During a calorie deficit, protein requirements increase because the body is more likely to break down muscle for energy, and higher protein intake helps preserve lean mass. This effect was demonstrated in a trial by Longland et al., which showed that participants consuming 2.4 g/kg <em>total body weight</em> during a 40% calorie deficit gained 1.2 kg of muscle while losing 4.8 kg of fat — compared to a lower-protein group that gained no muscle <span class="cite" title="Longland, T.M., et al.

            <p>These values align with the position stands of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), which recommends 1.4–2.0 g/kg <em>total body weight</em> for exercising individuals, and considers intakes up to 3.0 g/kg safe during energy restriction <span class="cite" title="Jäger, R., et al. (2017). Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, 14, 20. doi:10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8">[13]</span>. A meta-analysis by Morton et al. identified 1.6 g/kg <em>total body weight</em> per day as the breakpoint beyond which additional protein produced no statistically significant further gains in muscle mass <span class="cite" title="Morton, R.W., et al. (2018). British Journal of Sports Medicine, 52(6), 376-384. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608">[14]</span>. That breakpoint of 1.6 g/kg BW is why our bulking multiplier for young adults sits at 2.0 g/kg LBM — a higher number on a smaller denominator, translating to a similar absolute amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Is more protein safe?</strong> Yes — but don't expect extra muscle from it. A one-year crossover trial by Antonio et al. tracked resistance-trained men alternating between normal (~2.5 g/kg/day) and high (~3.3 g/kg/day) protein phases — roughly four times the RDA. The result: no adverse effects on blood lipids, liver, or kidneys, and no increase in fat mass despite consuming more calories. But also no additional lean mass gains <span class="cite" title="Antonio, J., et al. (2016). Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism, 2016, 9104792. doi:10.1155/2016/9104792">[20]</span>. Combined with Morton's breakpoint at 1.6 g/kg BW, the evidence is clear: the muscle-building benefit of protein plateaus, and going beyond that is safe but won't give you a compositional edge.</p>

            <div class="why-box">
                <strong>The bottom line:</strong> Don't worry about overshooting your protein target — the research shows no harm from higher intakes. But don't undershoot it either.

Lacto-ovo vegetarians, however, have access to whey (DIAAS 1.09), eggs (DIAAS &gt; 1.0), and casein — all of which match or exceed meat in protein quality. When dairy and eggs are part of the diet, no adjustment is needed. A study comparing vegetarian and omnivorous athletes found the protein quality gap can be closed with as little as 10–15 g of dairy or egg per plant-based meal.</p>

                <div class="answer">Fat tissue does not require significant protein for maintenance. Calculating protein per kg of total body weight would over-prescribe for someone at 35% body fat and under-prescribe for someone at 12%. Using lean body mass standardizes the recommendation to the tissue that actually needs protein — your muscles, organs, and connective tissue. This approach is consistent with recent position stands from the ESPEN expert group for clinical populations <span class="cite" title="Deutz, N.E., et al. (2014). Clinical Nutrition, 33(6), 929-936">[18]</span>.</div>

                <div class="answer">All BMR equations are estimates — individual variation of 5–15% is normal. Katch-McArdle tends to be more accurate than Harris-Benedict or Mifflin-St Jeor when body fat percentage is known, because it accounts for the metabolic difference between fat and lean tissue. If you know your body composition (from a DEXA scan, for example), Katch-McArdle is the better choice. If you only know your height, weight, and age, Mifflin-St Jeor may perform comparably.</div>

            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">Q: What is body recomposition, and can it really work?</div>
                <div class="answer">Recomposition means losing fat while gaining muscle simultaneously, typically at a stable body weight. The traditional view was that this required either a surplus (to build) or a deficit (to lose), making simultaneous change impossible. Research has since shown that recomp is achievable — particularly for beginners, those returning from a training break, and individuals with higher body fat who have ample energy stores. A trial by Longland et al. showed that high protein (2.4 g/kg) combined with intense resistance training produced +1.2 kg lean mass and −4.8 kg fat mass during a 40% calorie deficit <span class="cite" title="Longland, T.M., et al. (2016). American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 103(3), 738-746. doi:10.3945/ajcn.115.119339">[11]</span>. Note: this was a 4-week protocol in young, overweight men (n=40) under supervised conditions — results may be smaller in magnitude for older adults, leaner individuals, or less aggressive training programmes. The calculator sets recomp at maintenance calories, where your existing fat stores supply the energy needed for muscle-building.</div>

            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">Q: Why doesn't the muscle-building mode use a fixed 500 kcal surplus?</div>
                <div class="answer">A 500 kcal surplus would work well for a young beginner who can gain nearly 1 kg of muscle per month. But for an intermediate or advanced lifter gaining 0.15 kg per month, a 500 kcal surplus would result in the vast majority of extra energy being stored as fat. The calculator's rate-matched surplus derives the daily surplus from your actual muscle gain rate, so the energy you consume matches the energy your body can use for tissue building. This approach is recommended by Helms and Israetel for natural athletes <span class="cite" title="Helms, E.R., et al. (2014).

            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">Q: I'm over 50 — can I still build meaningful muscle?</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes, but the rate will be slower. Anabolic resistance — the blunted response to protein and exercise that comes with age — is real but not absolute. Kumar et al. showed that muscle protein synthesis in older adults (~70 years) is approximately 30% lower than in young adults after resistance exercise <span class="cite" title="Kumar, V., et al. (2009). The Journal of Physiology, 587(1), 211-217. doi:10.1113/jphysiol.2008.164483">[8]</span>. However, older adults still respond to training with measurable hypertrophy, provided protein intake is sufficient (the per-meal threshold is higher, around 30–40 g) and training stimulus is adequate. The calculator applies age modifiers to set realistic expectations: a 60-year-old may gain muscle at roughly 40% of a 25-year-old's rate, but gains are still possible and clinically significant for maintaining independence and reducing fall risk.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">Q: Why does the calculator cap fat loss rate based on body fat percentage?</div>
                <div class="answer">Leaner individuals have less stored energy available per day. Alpert showed that fat stores can release a maximum of roughly 31 kcal per pound of fat per day, so people with less body fat simply cannot fuel large deficits without breaking down muscle <span class="cite" title="Alpert, S.S. (2005). Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(1), 1-13. doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.08.020">[5]</span>. The body-fat-scaled formula (BF% ÷ 20 = weekly % body weight loss) is a practical approximation of this principle: at 30% body fat, you can safely lose ~1.5% of body weight per week; at 12%, the safe rate drops to ~0.6%. Research in elite athletes confirms that slower rates (0.7% per week) preserve lean mass significantly better than faster rates <span class="cite" title="Garthe, I., et al. (2011). International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 21(2), 97-104. doi:10.1123/ijsnem.21.2.97">[9]</span>.

                <div class="question">Q: What is FFMI and why should I care about it?</div>
                <div class="answer">FFMI (Fat-Free Mass Index) is to muscularity what BMI is to overall size — it normalizes your lean mass for your height. A 90 kg lean person who is 190 cm tall has a very different physique than a 90 kg lean person at 170 cm. FFMI lets the calculator estimate how close you are to your natural muscular potential, which directly affects your expected rate of muscle gain. It was validated by Kouri et al. using data from natural and steroid-using bodybuilders <span class="cite" title="Kouri, E.M., et al. (1995).

                <div class="question">Q: Do vegans really need 25% more protein? What about vegetarians?</div>
                <div class="answer">For vegans, yes. The adjustment compensates for lower digestibility and a less favourable amino acid profile — particularly leucine, the key trigger for muscle protein synthesis. The DIAAS for most plant sources falls well below animal sources, so the 25% increase brings the effective protein roughly in line with an omnivore diet <span class="cite" title="van Vliet, S., et al. (2015). Journal of Nutrition, 145(9), 1981-1991. doi:10.3945/jn.114.204305">[15]</span>. Some plant proteins (soy, pea isolate) score closer to animal sources, and combining complementary proteins helps, but the gap remains meaningful for a fully vegan diet. For vegetarians who include dairy and eggs, no adjustment is needed — whey protein isolate (DIAAS 1.09), eggs, and casein all match or exceed the protein quality of meat. A whey shake or a couple of eggs alongside plant-based meals closes the amino acid gap entirely.</div>

            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">Q: Why are there different calorie strategies for different goals?</div>
                <div class="answer">Each goal demands a different energy environment. Fat loss requires a deficit to force the body to use stored energy. Muscle building requires a surplus to provide raw materials and signaling for tissue construction. Recomposition works at maintenance because body fat stores serve as an internal energy reservoir — you are simultaneously losing fat (releasing energy) and building muscle (using that energy). Trying to build muscle in a large deficit or lose fat in a large surplus would work against your goal in each case.</div>

                <div class="question">Q: How should I use these numbers in practice?</div>
                <div class="answer">Treat the calculator's output as a starting point. Track your weight, body measurements, and performance for 2–3 weeks and adjust. If you are losing weight faster than projected, increase calories slightly. If weight isn't changing but your goal is fat loss, decrease by 100–200 kcal. The protein target is more fixed — hit it consistently. For personalized guidance, consider working with a qualified nutritionist or using the coaching program for expert support.</div>
