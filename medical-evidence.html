                        Missing recommended screenings allows conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cancers to develop undetected. Many of these conditions are asymptomatic in early stages but treatable when caught early. Your low screening score means you're missing critical opportunities for early intervention — opportunities that literally add years to your life.

                        Most screening gaps can be closed in a single visit to your primary care provider. Schedule a comprehensive checkup covering blood pressure, lipid panel, and glucose. Age-appropriate cancer screenings (colonoscopy, mammography, etc.) can then be prioritized. Unlike many health improvements that take months, medical screening compliance can improve rapidly.

                        Set calendar reminders for your next screening dates. Consistency matters — some conditions require periodic rescreening (e.g., colonoscopy every 10 years).

                        Germany's GKV covers <strong>10+ preventive screenings at no cost</strong> to insured members, including the comprehensive Check-up 35 (every 3 years from age 35), skin cancer screening (every 2 years), cancer screenings for cervical, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, dental check-ups (twice yearly), and a one-time AAA ultrasound for men at 65.

                    The German system is structured around age-triggered entitlements defined in §25 of Social Code Book V. The cornerstone is the <strong>Check-up 35</strong> — a comprehensive health examination covering blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, kidney function, and hepatitis B/C screening (added in 2020). You can have one check-up between ages 18–34, then every 3 years from 35 onward.

                    Cancer screenings are generous: skin cancer screening every 2 years from age 35, cervical screening from 20 (Pap annually, then Pap+HPV co-test every 3 years from 35), annual prostate exam from 45, colorectal screening from 50 (stool test or colonoscopy), and mammography every 2 years from 50–75 (recently extended from 69). Most screenings require no referral — you can schedule directly with the specialist.

                    The US system differs from European models in that there is no single national health service. Instead, the USPSTF — an independent panel of experts — evaluates evidence and assigns letter grades (A through D, plus I for insufficient evidence). Grades A and B are the strongest recommendations, and the ACA mandates that private insurers cover these services with no out-of-pocket cost.

                <p class="prose">
                    The US approach is notably more aggressive in some areas: mammography starts at 40 (vs 50 in Germany), colorectal screening at 45 (vs 50 in Europe), and lung cancer LDCT screening is established for high-risk smokers. On the other hand, the US lacks a structured general check-up equivalent to Germany's Check-up 35 — preventive services are typically accessed through annual wellness visits coordinated by a primary care physician.

                    <div class="quick-answer-text">
                        The EU Council updated its cancer screening recommendation in December 2022, expanding from 3 cancer types (breast, cervical, colorectal) to <strong>6 types</strong> — adding lung, prostate, and gastric cancer in a stepwise approach. The goal is for <strong>90% of eligible EU citizens</strong> to be offered screening by 2025. Non-cancer screenings (blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes) are left to individual member states.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="prose">
                    The EU's screening framework is primarily a cancer-focused recommendation — unlike Germany's GKV or the US USPSTF, it does not cover cardiovascular or metabolic screening at the EU level. Those are delegated to national health systems, which is why the screenings shown for "EU (other)" combine the EU cancer recommendations with common national-level cardiovascular screenings.
                </p>
                <p class="prose">
                    The 2022 update was a major expansion of the original 2003 recommendation. For established cancers, the evidence base is strong: mammography from age 45–74 (extended from 50–69), HPV-based cervical screening from 30–65, and colorectal FIT testing from 50–74. For the three new cancers (lung, prostate, gastric), the EU recommends a cautious stepwise rollout — pilot programmes first, then gradual expansion based on real-world outcomes.

                        If your country's specific guidelines aren't listed, or you're unsure which system applies, we show a <strong>universal baseline of 6 core screenings</strong> recommended by the WHO and international medical consensus: blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, dental check-ups, eye exams, and colorectal cancer screening. These represent the minimum standard that virtually all healthcare systems agree on.
                    </div>

                <p class="prose">
                    This baseline reflects the common ground across international guidelines. Blood pressure and cholesterol screening are universally recommended because cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death. Diabetes screening catches a reversible condition early. Colorectal cancer screening is supported by strong evidence across all populations. Dental and eye exams prevent irreversible damage from conditions that develop silently.

                <p class="prose">
                    Your country may offer additional screenings beyond this baseline — particularly for breast, cervical, prostate, and skin cancers. We recommend checking with your national health service or primary care physician for the most complete list of entitlements.

                        A landmark analysis of 61 studies involving 1 million subjects found a continuous risk relationship: each 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure doubles CVD death risk. The landmark SPRINT trial showed that intensive BP control (target 120 vs 140 mmHg) reduced cardiovascular events by 25% and mortality by 27%.

                    An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulging of the aorta. It often has no symptoms until rupture, which is fatal in ~80% of cases. Screening with ultrasound is non-invasive, inexpensive, and detects AAA while elective repair can prevent rupture.
