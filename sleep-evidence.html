                        Poor sleep significantly increases mortality risk. Short sleep duration (<7 hours) is associated with a <strong>12% increase in all-cause mortality</strong>, while long sleep (≥9 hours) raises risk by <strong>30%</strong>. Even more striking: the most irregular sleepers face <strong>20–48% higher mortality risk</strong> compared to the most regular sleepers. Poor sleep also impairs immune function, cardiovascular health, and cognitive performance. The encouraging news: sleep is one of the most modifiable longevity factors.

                        Your body runs on a circadian clock that regulates hormone release, immune function, and metabolic processes on a ~24-hour cycle. Irregular sleep disrupts this clock. A study of 60,977 adults found that <strong>sleep regularity predicted mortality more strongly than sleep duration</strong> — even after accounting for how long people slept.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) — which measures the consistency of sleep-wake patterns — was developed as an objective metric using accelerometer data from wrist-worn devices. When Windred et al. applied it to UK Biobank participants, they found a dose-response relationship: more regular sleep was consistently associated with lower mortality risk across all causes of death, including cardiovascular and cancer mortality.
                
                </p>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    The biological explanation centers on circadian alignment. When you sleep at consistent times, your internal clock synchronizes hormone secretion (cortisol, melatonin, growth hormone), immune cell cycling, and metabolic processes. Irregular sleep creates a state similar to chronic jet lag, where these systems are perpetually out of sync — leading to systemic inflammation, metabolic disruption, and impaired immune surveillance.
                
                </p>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    This is why our assessment scores sleep regularity as its own question, separate from duration. Even if you sleep 7–8 hours per night, doing so on a wildly irregular schedule may undermine much of the benefit. Conversely, keeping a highly consistent schedule — even with slightly shorter sleep — appears to offer meaningful protection.

                        Probably not. A landmark study showed that <strong>people who sleep 6 hours per night for 14 days perform as poorly as someone who has been completely sleep-deprived for 2 days</strong> — yet they rate themselves as only mildly sleepy. Your brain adapts to feeling less tired, but the cognitive impairment keeps accumulating.

                    One of the most insidious aspects of chronic sleep restriction is that subjective sleepiness plateaus after a few days, creating the illusion that you've adapted. But objective measures of cognitive performance tell a different story:

                    The landmark Van Dongen et al. laboratory study showed that people restricted to 6 hours per night for two weeks performed as poorly on cognitive tests as someone who had been completely sleep-deprived for 48 hours straight — yet they rated themselves as only mildly sleepy [1]. You may genuinely feel fine on 6 hours, but objective testing reveals accumulating deficits. This subjective adaptation is deceptive.

                    From a longevity perspective, the Cappuccio et al. meta-analysis is sobering: sleeping less than 7 hours is associated with a 12% higher mortality risk. While a small minority of people carry a genetic variant (DEC2 gene) that allows them to function on less sleep, this is exceptionally rare — estimated at less than 1% of the population. The vast majority of people who believe they function well on 6 hours are experiencing the cognitive self-awareness paradox: they've adapted to feeling less tired, but their actual performance and health continue to decline unseen.

                        Subjective sleep quality — how you personally rate your sleep — is one of <strong>six core dimensions of sleep health</strong> identified in the scientific framework used by sleep medicine. Poor self-rated sleep quality predicts cardiovascular disease, depression, and cognitive decline independently of sleep duration. Your rating captures information that objective measures alone miss.

                    Sleep researchers used to focus almost exclusively on sleep duration. But the influential sleep health model proposed by Buysse identifies six dimensions that matter: Satisfaction, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration, and Regularity (the "RU SATED" framework). Subjective satisfaction — how you feel about your sleep — captures a constellation of factors that objective measures like wearables can miss, including sleep depth, dream quality, and restorative feeling.

                    The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the most widely used subjective sleep quality measure in clinical research, predicts outcomes across multiple health domains. Low subjective sleep quality is consistently associated with increased inflammatory markers, higher rates of depression and anxiety, impaired immune function, and accelerated cognitive aging. This is why our assessment asks you to rate your sleep quality directly — your perception contains valid health-relevant information that complements objective measures.

                        Non-restorative sleep — waking unrefreshed despite adequate hours — is associated with a <strong>23% higher all-cause mortality risk</strong> and a <strong>48% higher cardiovascular mortality risk</strong>. Among all insomnia symptoms, non-restorative sleep has the strongest link to mortality. Waking refreshed signals that your sleep achieved its biological purpose: repair, consolidation, and restoration.

                    Many people assume that sleeping 7–8 hours automatically means good sleep. But sleep duration and sleep restoration are distinct dimensions. You can sleep the right number of hours and still wake feeling exhausted — a pattern called non-restorative sleep (NRS). A major meta-analysis examined individual insomnia symptoms and their association with mortality to understand which aspects of poor sleep carry the greatest risk:

                    Why is non-restorative sleep so harmful? The "alertness" dimension in the RU SATED sleep health framework reflects whether sleep fulfilled its core biological functions: memory consolidation, cellular repair, metabolic waste clearance (via the glymphatic system), and immune cell regeneration [2]. When you wake unrefreshed, it suggests these processes were incomplete — possibly due to fragmented sleep architecture, reduced deep sleep, or disrupted sleep stages, even if total time in bed looked adequate.

                        Difficulty falling or staying asleep — even when total sleep time is adequate — is associated with a <strong>13% increase in all-cause mortality</strong> and a <strong>20% increase in cardiovascular mortality</strong>. Frequent sleep disturbances fragment your sleep architecture, reducing the deep sleep and REM sleep your body needs for repair and cognitive maintenance.

                    Sleep disturbances encompass difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia), and early morning awakening. These aren't just annoyances — they carry measurable health consequences. The Ge et al. meta-analysis, which analyzed 29 prospective cohorts following over 1.5 million people, found that difficulty falling asleep (DFA) was independently associated with mortality:
                
                </p>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    The biological mechanism centers on sleep fragmentation. Each time you wake during the night or struggle to fall asleep, your body initiates a stress response — cortisol spikes, heart rate increases, and blood pressure rises. Repeated nightly, this creates a pattern of chronic physiological stress. Fragmented sleep also reduces time spent in deep (N3) sleep and REM sleep — the stages most critical for physical repair, immune function, and memory consolidation.
                
                </p>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    Importantly, the Ge et al. meta-analysis graded the evidence for DFA-mortality as "moderate certainty" using the GRADE framework — a meaningful level of confidence. If you experience trouble falling or staying asleep more than 3 nights per week for longer than 3 months, this meets the clinical threshold for chronic insomnia, and CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) is the recommended first-line treatment.

                        Regularly sleeping 9 or more hours is associated with a <strong>30–39% higher all-cause mortality risk</strong>. However, the leading explanation is that long sleep serves as a <strong>marker of underlying disease</strong> — not that sleeping long directly causes harm. If you consistently need 9+ hours, it may be worth investigating with your physician.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    The association between long sleep and increased mortality has been consistently found across multiple large meta-analyses. The Cappuccio et al. meta-analysis found a 30% increased risk (RR 1.30), while a more recent meta-analysis by Jike et al. found a 39% increase (RR 1.39) for long sleepers [1].
                
                </p>

                <p class="prose">
                    
                    However, researchers increasingly believe this represents reverse causation rather than a direct causal pathway. The Jike et al. meta-analysis notes that long sleep may reflect underlying systemic disease, increased sleep fragmentation (spending more time in bed but sleeping poorly), subclinical conditions not yet diagnosed, depression, or chronic inflammation [1]. In other words, the disease process may cause the long sleep, rather than long sleep causing disease.

                    This is why our scoring follows the U-shaped curve: both very short and very long sleep receive lower scores, with 7–8 hours as optimal. If you consistently sleep 9+ hours despite good sleep hygiene and still feel unrefreshed, consider discussing this with your doctor to rule out conditions like sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, depression, or other underlying factors.

                        Evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest weekend catch-up sleep may partially offset health risks, but the resulting <strong>"social jet lag"</strong> — the shift in sleep timing between workdays and free days — is itself associated with <strong>increased cardiovascular risk and metabolic disruption</strong>. A consistent schedule across all 7 days is the strongest approach.
                    </div>

                    "Social jet lag" describes the discrepancy between your body's circadian rhythm and your social schedule. If you sleep midnight–6am on weekdays but 2am–10am on weekends, you're essentially giving yourself a 2-hour jet lag every Monday. Epidemiological research associates social jet lag with increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, with risk increasing for each additional hour of discrepancy [1].

                    A device-measured study in UK Biobank participants found that weekend catch-up sleep was not significantly associated with reduced mortality or cardiovascular disease risk, challenging the assumption that weekend recovery can fully compensate for workweek sleep debt [2]. While a Brazilian cohort study (ELSA-Brasil) did find some cardiovascular benefit from weekend extension, the overall evidence suggests that prevention — sleeping consistently well across all days — is far more effective than compensation.

                    This is a key reason our assessment measures sleep regularity separately from duration. Someone who sleeps 6 hours on weekdays and 10 hours on weekends may average 7.1 hours per night — which looks fine by duration alone — but the irregular pattern carries its own health costs. Aiming for a consistent schedule (±30 minutes) is more protective than trying to bank or recover sleep.

                        Behavioral interventions (consistent schedule, caffeine timing, CBT-I) outperform all supplements. Among supplements, <strong>magnesium</strong> has the strongest evidence — reducing sleep onset by ~17 minutes in older adults. <strong>Ashwagandha</strong> (≥600 mg/day) shows small but significant improvements, especially for stress-related sleep issues. <strong>Glycine</strong> (3 g) lowers core temperature to promote sleep onset. <strong>Melatonin</strong> has the most modest effect (~7 min faster onset) but is useful for circadian timing issues like jet lag.

                    <strong>1. Magnesium — strongest supplement evidence.</strong> A systematic review and meta-analysis of older adults found that magnesium supplementation significantly improved sleep quality, reducing sleep onset latency by approximately 17 minutes [1]. A 2023 systematic review confirmed the association between magnesium status and sleep quality, noting that ~50% of adults in Western diets are magnesium-deficient — meaning supplementation may partly correct an underlying nutritional gap rather than acting as a sleep drug [2]. Typical effective dose: 200–400 mg magnesium glycinate or threonate before bed.

                    <strong>2. Ashwagandha — promising for stress-related sleep issues.</strong> A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (n=400) found ashwagandha extract produced a small but significant improvement in overall sleep quality (SMD −0.59) [3]. A 2024 update confirmed improvements in sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and PSQI scores [4]. Effects were strongest at ≥600 mg/day for ≥8 weeks and in those with diagnosed insomnia. The dual mechanism — cortisol reduction plus GABAergic activity — makes it particularly suitable when poor sleep is driven by stress or anxiety.

                    <strong>3. Glycine — works through body temperature.</strong> Taking 3 g of glycine before bedtime activates NMDA receptors in the brain's circadian clock, triggering peripheral vasodilation that lowers core body temperature — mimicking the natural cooling signal for sleep onset. Multiple small RCTs found improved subjective sleep quality and next-day alertness [5]. A 2024 systematic review acknowledged promise but flagged high risk of bias due to small sample sizes.

                    <strong>4. Melatonin — useful for timing, not power.</strong> Melatonin is not a sedative — it's a circadian signaling hormone. Meta-analyses show it reduces sleep onset by about 7 minutes and increases total sleep by about 8 minutes. Evidence suggests taking it earlier (up to 3 hours before bedtime) at doses of 1–5 mg is most effective. Its best use case is circadian realignment: jet lag, shift work, or delayed sleep phase disorder.

                    <strong>1. Consistent sleep schedule.</strong> Based on the Windred et al. findings, regularity is the single most impactful sleep behavior for longevity. Set a fixed bedtime and wake time — including weekends — with no more than 30 minutes of variation. Your circadian clock needs consistent cues to function optimally.

                    <strong>2. Caffeine timing.</strong> A meta-analysis of 24 studies found that caffeine reduces total sleep time by 45 minutes and deep sleep by 11 minutes. To avoid meaningful sleep disruption, coffee (about 100 mg caffeine) should be consumed at least 8.8 hours before bedtime — and stronger sources like pre-workout supplements at least 13 hours before [1].

A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis (22 studies, n=685) found that light therapy significantly improved sleep maintenance — reducing time awake during the night [2]. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light (~10,000 lux) vastly exceeds indoor lighting (~500 lux). Aim for 10–30 minutes of outdoor morning light — this anchors your circadian clock and promotes timely melatonin release ~14 hours later.

Most sleep experts recommend 17–20°C. Darkness is equally critical — even dim light during sleep suppresses melatonin and disrupts circadian signaling.

The mechanism is paradoxical: warming the skin surface triggers vasodilation and subsequent core body temperature drop — the same physiological signal your body uses to initiate sleep.

CBT-I for chronic insomnia.</strong> If you've struggled with insomnia for more than 3 months, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment — ahead of medication. A meta-analysis found that CBT-I produces clinically significant improvements lasting up to 12 months, and unlike medication, the benefits persist after treatment ends [5]. Digital CBT-I programs are increasingly available and have also shown effectiveness.

                    Sleep improvement is highly individual — what works depends on your specific patterns, schedule constraints, and underlying factors. A sleep specialist or coach can help identify your personal barriers and design a targeted plan. If you suspect a sleep disorder (persistent insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring with pauses, or restless legs), consider discussing a formal sleep evaluation with your physician.

                    For those with chronic insomnia specifically, CBT-I delivered by a trained therapist is the gold standard treatment. Many sleep clinics and online platforms now offer evidence-based CBT-I programs. Your assessment results provide a baseline to track improvement — revisit the sleep questions periodically to see how interventions are working.
